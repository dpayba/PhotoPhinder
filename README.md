### Important Commands
1. Start by cloning repository
2. Change directory to **cs35l-project-react-app**
3. Run essential npm commands
    - ```npm install``` (installs dependencies listed in package.json)
    - ```npm start```

When adding a new node package to the project, make sure to install the package with the --save option (e.g. **npm install --save NEWPACKAGE**). This will allow other contributors to simply run **npm install** next time they merge your changes, without having to install each package and its correct version one-by-one.
